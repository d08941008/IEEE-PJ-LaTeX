The 1 × 4 (de-)multiplexers are designed for a channel separation of 25 nm and operate within 990$-$1065 nm for bottom emitting vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL)-based optical links. For Si3N4 Gaussian AWGs, we demonstrate crosstalk \&lt;$-$35 dB at the peak transmission band with insertion loss \&lt;0.5 dB. Measurements were performed over many dies, and pass-band standard deviations for channel 1$-$4 are 0.49, 0.66, 0.42, and 0.37 nm, respectively. Results for flat-top AWGs indicate crosstalk \&lt;$-$20 dB, with insertion loss \&lt;3 dB for the best devices. Flat-top cascaded 2nd order and 3rd order MZI lattice filters show a minimum of crosstalk \&lt;$-$15 dB and \&lt;$-$20 dB, respectively. The pass-band temperature shift was determined to be 14.5 pm/\textdegreeC, which is lower than reported values for silicon. The device footprint of the Gaussian and flat-top AWGs are both $\sim$670 × 200 $\mu$m. The device footprint of the flat-top cascaded 2nd order and 3rd order lattice filters are 1160 × 470 $\mu$m and 1570 × 470 $\mu$m, respectively. We believe the Si3N4 platform has potential for its use in CWDM and possibly DWDM transceiver/optical-modules for data/computer communication in high temperature environments up to 80 \textdegreeC.},

    The most commonly studied resonators are ring/racetrack resonators. We have fabricated these and other resonators including
    disk resonators, waveguide-grating resonators, ring resonator reflectors, contra-directional grating-coupler ring
    resonators, and racetrack-based multiplexer/demultiplexers.
    While numerous resonators have been demonstrated for sensing purposes, it remains unclear as to which structures
    provide the highest sensitivity and best limit of detection; for example, disc resonators and slot-waveguide-based ring
    resonators have been conjectured to provide an improved limit of detection. Here, we compare various resonators in
    terms of sensor metrics for label-free bio-sensing in a micro-fluidic environment. We have integrated resonator arrays with
    PDMS micro-fluidics for real-time detection of biomolecules in experiments such as antigen-antibody binding reaction
    experiments using Human Factor IX proteins. Numerous resonators are fabricated on the same wafer and experimentally
    compared. We identify that, while evanescent-field sensors all operate on the principle that the analyte's refractive index
    shifts the resonant frequency, there are important differences between implementations that lie in the relationship between
    the optical field overlap with the analyte and the relative contributions of the various loss mechanisms.

The mode demultiplexer has a 2.3 $\mu$m-wide multimode bus waveguide, which supports six mode-channels of TE polarization and four mode-channels of TM polarization. These ten mode-channels are (de)multiplexed with five cascaded dual-core adiabatic tapers based on SOI nanowires. The widths for these dual-cores are chosen optimally according to the dispersion curves of the dual-core SOI nanowire, so that the desired highest-order modes of TE- and TM-polarizations are extracted simultaneously. These two extracted mode-channels are coupled very efficiently to the fundamental modes of TE- and TM-polarizations (TE0 and TM0) in the narrow waveguide, respectively, which are then separated by using a polarization beam splitter based on bent directional couplers. A chip consisting of a pair of 10-channel mode (de)multiplexers is fabricated and then tested with data transmission of 30Gbps/channel. The measurement results show that all TM- and TE mode-channels have low crosstalks ($-$15$\sim$$-$25 dB) and low excess losses (0.2$\sim$1.8 dB) over a broad wavelength band of $\sim$90 nm, which makes it WDM (wavelength-division-multiplexing)-compatible and thus suitable for high capacity on-chip optical interconnects.},

However, high-quality THz signal generation and noise-robust signal detection remain challenging owing to the presence of inter-channel crosstalk and additive noise in THz wireless environments. Here, we report coherent THz wireless communication using a silicon photonic integrated circuit that includes a dual-parallel Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) and advanced digital signal processing (DSP). The structure and fabrication of the dual-parallel MZM-based silicon photonic integrated circuit are systematically optimized using the figure of merit (FOM) method to improve the modulation efficiency while reducing the overall optical loss. The advanced DSP compensates for in-phase and quadrature (IQ) imbalance as well as phase noise by orthogonally decoupling the IQ components in the frequency domain after adaptive signal equalization and carrier phase estimation. The experimental results show a reduction in phase noise that induces degradation of transmission performance, successfully demonstrating error-free 1-m THz wireless transmission with bit-error rates of 10\&\#x2212;6 or less at a data rate of 50 Gbps.},

Although add/drop filters based on ring resonators and waveguide Bragg gratings are well developed, long period waveguide grating (LPWG) based add/drop filters have little been investigated so far. In this article, we propose an apodized LPWG assisted co-directional coupler for narrow band add/drop filtering by combining silicon (Si) waveguide with titanium dioxide (TiO2) waveguide geometry. The proposed structure has been analyzed by combining the finite element method (FEM) and transfer matrix method (TMM), showing a good side lobe suppression ratio (SLSR) equal to 25.7 dB and an insertion loss of 0.6 dB. Owing to the high group index difference of Si and TiO2 waveguides, a narrow band response of 1.4 nm has been achieved with 800{\textmu}m long LPWG. The opposite thermo-optic coefficients of Si and TiO2 ensures a good thermal tunability of the central wavelength. Considering a thin metallic heater of titanium nitride (TiN) the thermal tuning efficiency is found to be 0.07 nm/mW. Further, two LPWGs have been cascaded to realize a tunable dual channel filter with a minimum channel spacing of 185 GHz and a channel crosstalk better than 20 dB, showing its potential application towards dense wavelength division multiplexing.},

A two-dimensional grating coupler structure with a high coupling efficiency and a low polarization dependent loss is demonstrated. Using two crossing ellipses as the grating scatter and a diamond-like grating lattice, the polarization dependent loss of the grating coupler can be reduced. The coupling loss is further decreased with a metal mirror, which reaches \&\#x2212;1.73 dB theoretically at 1310 nm wavelength. Experimentally, \&\#x2212;2.37 dB coupling loss is achieved with an 1 dB coupling bandwidth of 29 nm. The corresponding PDL was measured lower than 0.2 dB in a wavelength range of 78 nm. The proposed configuration for the metal mirror also facilitates a robust wafer-scale post-processing as well as an easy fiber alignment.},

The MZM is in a push-pull configuration that is constructed using an ITO/graphene-based silicon waveguide. A novel idea for engineering of the plasma dispersion effect in an ITO/graphene-based waveguide is proposed so that the modulation characteristics of the MZM are highly improved. Plasma dispersion effects of ITO and graphene layers are tailored in such a way that a large difference between real parts of guided mode effective index of the two arms is achieved while their corresponding imaginary parts are equal. As a result, a very low $${{\mathrm {V}}}_{\pi }L_{\pi }$$of $$10 \, \hbox {V} \upmu \hbox {m}$$is achieved. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the lowest $${{\mathrm {V}}}_{\pi }L_{\pi }$$reported for an electro-optic modulator. In addition, the proposed modulator exhibits a very high extinction ratio of more than 30 dB, low insertion loss of 2.8 dB and energy consumption of as low as 10 fJ/bit, which are all promising for optical communication and processing systems.},

The Ge lateral p-i-n WPD reveals an optical responsivity of 0.63-0.74 A\&\#x002F;W at 1327.5 nm under \&#x2212;1.8 V bias.The noise equivalent power (NEP) is increased from 0.11 to 0.2 pW\&\#x002F;&#x221A;Hz by shrinking the transmission-line contact electrode length from 280 to 80 \&#x03BC;m. After optimizing the transmission-line designs with shorter length and less right corner number (C<sub>&#x22A5;</sub>&#x0023;) between PD and bonding pad, the Ge lateral p-i-n WPD improves its RLC response to suppress its switching time with broadened receiving bandwidth. Shrinking the connecting transmission-line length from 280 \&#x03BC;m to 80 \&#x03BC;m extends the flattened S<sub>11</sub> spectral response from 51 to 57 GHz by up-shifting the inductor inductor-induced frequency notch from 58 to 61 GHz, as confirmed by the shrank spiral curve in the Smith chart with the decreased inductance by shortening the transmission-line electrode. The dual-wavelength optical heterodyne analysis demonstrates that the Ge p-i-n WPD significantly improves its analog receiving bandwidth from 29.5 to 44.3 GHz measured at 6-dB decay. The sub-ps laser pulse illumination observes that the Ge p-i-n WPD response shortens its impulse response from 23.14 to 19.92 ps by reducing the contact inductor length (by 200 \&#x03BC;m) and right corner number (C<sub>&#x22A5;</sub>&#x0023;) from 4 to 2) of its electrode.

The device is composed of a multi-tip section and a combiner section with extra offset regions to reduce the mode mismatch caused by the structural discontinuity which results from a limitation of the fabrication process that creates an inevitable gap width at the junction between the two sections. The widths and the spacing of the tips for the multi-tip section and the extra offset region for the combiner section are fine-tuned by using the particle swarm optimization method to reduce the mode mismatch. A high overall coupling efficiency up to 90.68\% (0.4249 dB) at 1550 nm can be achieved for the optimized 90-$\mu$m-long four-tip edge coupler. The device can be operated over a broad spectral range of 1260-1675 nm with less than 1 dB extra loss. With its high-efficiency ultra-broadband operation and small device footprint, the proposed device is promising for laser-to-chip edge coupling in silicon photonics.},

As-realized CWDM (de)multiplexer exhibits a spectral shift of 0.487 nm, an insertion loss of less than 2.1 dB, and a channel crosstalk of lower than -20 dB, while reference devices fabricated on the same chips suffer from serious spectral shift of 15.4 nm to the shorter wavelength and higher insertion loss/channel crosstalk.

More importantly, it can perform a global search over the entire search space with faster convergence speed. The APSO consists of two main steps. First, by evaluating the population distribution and particle fitness, a real-time evolutionary state estimation procedure is performed to identify one of the following four defined evolutionary states, including exploration, exploitation, convergence, and jumping out in each generation. It enables the automatic control of inertia weight, acceleration coefficients, and other algorithmic parameters at run time to improve the search efficiency and convergence speed. Then, an elitist learning strategy is performed when the evolutionary state is classified as convergence state. The strategy will act on the globally best particle to jump out of the likely local optima. The APSO has comprehensively been evaluated on 12 unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions. The effects of parameter adaptation and elitist learning will be studied. Results show that APSO substantially enhances the performance of the PSO paradigm in terms of convergence speed, global optimality, solution accuracy, and algorithm reliability. As APSO introduces two new parameters to the PSO paradigm only, it does not introduce an additional design or implementation complexity.},

   ignoreabstract = {Arrayed Waveguide Grating (AWG) for Coarse wavelength division multiplexing (CWDM) system is a key component of above 100Gb/s high-speed optical transmission module in telecommunication and interconnects for data center. Based on the theory of light transmission, the relationships between structure parameters and optical performance of AWG chip are analyzed. Four-channel AWG MUX/DEMUX chips for CWDM system at O-band are designed and simulated according to the relationships. The simulation results show that the insertion loss of the MUX is below 0.8 dB with non-uniformity of 0.07 dB. The bandwidths at 1 dB and 3 dB are more than 10 nm and 17 nm, respectively. For DEMUX, multi-mode interference (MMI) couplers are introduced at the start of output waveguides to produce flat-top spectral response with 1 dB bandwidth of 12 nm. The lowest insertion loss and adjacent crosstalk are 2.78 dB and below $-$20 dB, respectively.},

Based on the optimized Rowland configuration, two 64 × 0.4 nm ultra-compact on-chip spectrometers using bidirectional AWGs with two side inputs and different lengths of free propagation region (FPR) are designed and fabricated. Due to the utilization of two side inputs, the footprint of AWG spectrometer is significantly reduced compared to the conventional one center-input AWG spectrometer with the same resolution. The reduced footprint contributes to the performance improvement for an AWG spectrometer on high index contrast platforms, which is verified in our fabricated spectrometers on the silicon-on-insulator platform. The demonstrated ultra-compact on-chip spectrometer has large potential applications in miniaturized spectral analysis systems on a chip.},

   ignoreabstract = {We propose an ultra-compact novel wavelength multiplexer employing a (N + 1) × (N + 1) arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) and a polarization-combiner-rotator (PCR) on the SOI platform, to realize a multiplexing for 2N wavelengths with a spacing of Δλ. The (N + 1) × (N + 1) AWG works at a bidirectional way to provide two groups of N × 1 wavelength multiplexing with each group having a channel spacing of 2×Δλ, and the central wavelengths of all input channels in one group have a wavelength shift of Δλ with respect to those in the other group. The double channel spacing results in a significant decrease on the footprint of the (N + 1) × (N + 1) AWG-based multiplexer compared with a conventional 2N × 1 AWG multiplexer with the same wavelength spacing Δλ. Due to the fact that a single mode fiber is insensitive to the polarization of input light, if we consider short reach datacom applications such as 100/400 GbE, the two separate multiplexing outputs of the (N + 1) × (N + 1) AWG can be combined as one output with one half wavelengths working at TE polarization and the other at TM polarization by employing a low loss and broadband PCR. In the experiment, we demonstrate a 16 × 200 GHz multiplexer based on a 9 × 9 AWG. The experimental results show that the on-chip loss of the fabricated multiplexer is 2.7 dB and the loss uniformity is 0.5 dB. The 1-dB and 3-dB bandwidths are \&gt;0.56 nm (i.e., 35\% of the wavelength spacing) and \&gt;1.1 nm (i.e., 69\% of the wavelength spacing), respectively. They can also be further increased by decreasing the gap between adjacent input waveguides at the interfaces of star couplers of the designed AWG without inducing an excess loss. The proposed multiplexer has great potential for application to future super large capacity (&gt; Tb/s) data transmission systems.},

    igabstract = {Up to now, the light coupling schemes of germanium-on-silicon photodetectors (Ge-on-Si PDs) could be divided into three main categories: (1)\&\#x00A0;vertical (or normal-incidence) illumination, which can be from the top or back of the wafer/chip, and waveguide-integrated coupling including (2)\&\#x00A0;butt coupling and (3)\&\#x00A0;evanescent coupling. In evanescent coupling the input waveguide can be positioned on top, at the bottom, or lateral to the absorber. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we propose the first concept of Ge-on-Si PD with double lateral silicon nitride (Si3N4) waveguides, which can serve as a novel waveguide-integrated coupling configuration: double lateral coupling. The Ge-on-Si PD with double lateral Si3N4 waveguides features uniform optical field distribution in the Ge region, which is very beneficial to improving the operation speed for high input power. The proposed Ge-on-Si PD is comprehensively characterized by static and dynamic measurements. The typical internal responsivity is evaluated to be 0.52\&\#x00A0;A/W at an input power of 25\&\#x00A0;mW. The equivalent circuit model and theoretical 3\&\#x00A0;dB opto-electrical (OE) bandwidth investigation of Ge-on-Si PD with lateral coupling are implemented. Based on the small-signal (S21) radio-frequency measurements, under 4\&\#x00A0;mA photocurrent, a 60\&\#x00A0;GHz bandwidth operating at \&\#x2212;3\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;V bias voltage is demonstrated. When the photocurrent is up to 12\&\#x00A0;mA, the 3\&\#x00A0;dB OE bandwidth still has 36\&\#x00A0;GHz. With 1\&\#x00A0;mA photocurrent, the 70, 80, 90, and 100\&\#x00A0;Gbit/s non-return-to-zero (NRZ) and 100, 120, 140, and 150\&\#x00A0;Gbit/s four-level pulse amplitude modulation clear openings of eye diagrams are experimentally obtained without utilizing any offline digital signal processing at the receiver side. In order to verify the high-power handling performance in high-speed data transmission, we investigate the eye diagram variations with the increase of photocurrents. The clear open electrical eye diagrams of 60\&\#x00A0;Gbit/s NRZ under 20\&\#x00A0;mA photocurrent are also obtained. Overall, the proposed lateral Si3N4 waveguide structure is flexibly extendable to a light coupling configuration of PDs, which makes it very attractive for developing high-performance silicon photonic integrated circuits in the future.},

As a complimentary platform to silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and III-V photonics, Si3N4 waveguide technology opens up a new generation of system-on-chip applications not achievable with the other platforms alone. The availability of low-loss waveguides (<;1 dB/m) that can handle high optical power can be engineered for linear and nonlinear optical functions, and that support a variety of passive and active building blocks opens new avenues for system-on-chip implementations. As signal bandwidth and data rates continue to increase, the optical circuit functions and complexity made possible with Si3N4 has expanded the practical application of optical signal processing functions that can reduce energy consumption, size and cost over today's digital electronic solutions. Researchers have been able to push the performance photonic-integrated components beyond other integrated platforms, including ultrahigh Q resonators, optical filters, highly coherent lasers, optical signal processing circuits, nonlinear optical devices, frequency comb generators, and biophotonic system-on-chip. This review paper covers the history of low-loss Si3N4 waveguide technology and a survey of worldwide research in a variety of device and applications as well as the status of Si3N4 foundries.},

    abstract = {A 16-channel 200GHz arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) (de)-multiplexer is demonstrated experimentally by utilizing Si3N4 buried optical waveguides, which have 50nm-thick Si3N4 cores and a 15$\mu$m-thick SiO2 cladding. The structure with an ultra-thin core layer helps to reduce the scattering due to the sidewall roughness and consequently shows very low loss of about 0.4~0.8dB/m. When using this type of optical waveguide for an AWG (de)multiplexer, there is no problem associated with gap refill using the upper-cladding material even when choosing a small (e.g., 1.0 $\mu$m) gap between adjacent arrayed waveguides, which helps to reduce the transition loss between the FPR (free-propagation region) and the arrayed waveguides. Therefore, the demonstrated AWG (de)multiplexer based on the present Si3N4 buried optical waveguides has a low on-chip loss. The fabricated AWG (de)multiplexer is characterized in two wavelength ranges around 1310nm and 1550nm, respectively. It shows that the crosstalk from adjacent and non-adjacent channels are about --30dB, and --40dB, respectively, at the wavelength range of 1310nm. The Si3N4 AWG (de)multiplexer has a temperature dependence of about 0.011nm/{\textdegree}C, which is close to that of a pure SiO2 AWG device.},
